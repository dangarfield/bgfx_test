# Basic Cmake BGFX help needed
> Target: Build run & debug `src/bgfx_glfw_test.cpp` with pure cmake, without visual studio, only visual studio code with library intellisense

- Configured .vscode files
- Added third_party git submodules for glfw and bgfx (well, bgfx.cmake)
- Cmake builds runs and debugs `src/hello.cpp` (hello world) and `src/glfw_test.cpp` (glfw only) perfectly well, but I can't make it work for anything with bgfx in it `src/bgfw_test.cpp` (bgfx only)
- g++.exe (MinGW.org GCC Build-2) 9.2.0, GNU gdb (GDB) 7.6.1

Please help / point me in the right direction!
